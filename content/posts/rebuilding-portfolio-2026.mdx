After years of maintaining a simple static site on Cloudflare Pages, I decided it was time for a refresh. The goal was to make the portfolio itself a showcase of modern web dev practices.

### Why the switch?

- **App Router** → Better routing, Server Components, streaming, and partial prerendering.
- **React Compiler** → Automatic memoization magic — fewer `useMemo` headaches.
- **shadcn/ui** → Beautiful, copy-paste components without fighting a full design system.
- **TypeScript everywhere** → End-to-end safety, even in MDX.

The new stack feels productive and the Lighthouse scores are excellent.

Here's a quick code snippet from the hero section:

```tsx
<Link href="/" className="flex items-center space-x-2 font-bold text-xl">
	<svg /* ... home icon */ />
	<span>Kevin Gillispie</span>
</Link>
```
