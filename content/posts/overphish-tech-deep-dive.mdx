Phishing remains one of the top attack vectors in 2026. OverPhish is my attempt at a minimal, auditable blocker that runs entirely in the browser.

Here's another paragraph highlighting the importance of fighting phishing attacks.

## Heading 2

Trying to generate CSS is a fantastic headache.

<div class="callout callout-info float-right ml-6 mb-6 w-full max-w-xs md:max-w-sm shadow-md border-2 rounded-lg">
	<div class="p-5 text-sm leading-relaxed">This is an info box!</div>
</div>

### Core techniques

- **Manifest V3** service worker for background processing
- **Declarative Net Request** rules for fast blocking
- **Local storage** for user allowlists (no cloud sync)
- **Size** — bundled to ~280 KB gzipped

#### Example rule logic:

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"priority": 1,
	"action": { "type": "block" },
	"condition": {
		"urlFilter": "||phishy-site.example^",
		"resourceTypes": ["main_frame", "sub_frame"]
	}
}
```
